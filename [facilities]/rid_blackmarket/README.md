# Description

    This is a black market weapon shop that uses a stock system.
    When stock runs out players are unable to purchase more weapons from this shop.
    After 24hrs (at the specified time in config) there is a new delivery of stock.
    
    Weapons are chosen at random from 3 categories; Pistols, Rifles and Snipers.
    New weapons are only chosen when stock of the current weapon is 0.
    So when there is still stock at the specified time the weapon will not be restocked or replaced.

    There is also an option for a script restart refill.
    Basically if the server or script is restarted you can have the 'stock' of weapons refilled to random values specified in Config file.
    Again this will only occur to the weapons that have 0 stock at the time of the restart.

    You can change what the weapons are changed to and everything about them, price, stock amounts etc.
