Config.DrawDistance = 100

-- ~ Second, "price =" - Set the price you want the gun to sell for in the black market.

-- ~ Third, "starting_stock =" - You can set how many of that gun stock. You can use math.random(#,#) to get a RANDOM amount,
-- or change "math.random(#,#)" to a static number like "6" to get exactly 6 if that weapon is chosen.
